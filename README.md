Leverage WebSocket in the Real World
====================================

WebSocket presentation using reveal.js

- Presentation is WebSocket to communicate between client and server.  
- Bidirectional communication over HTTP has long been the product of hacks such as hidden iframes, AJAX, and long polling.
- Server-end has never been clean to develop for, and resource intensive to deal with
- To keep things simple we're going to utilize JavaScript as the language for front-end and back-end code.  Yay for Node.js
- Hello, World! using WebSocket
- Simple chat server using Node.js and a JavaScript server on the frontend
